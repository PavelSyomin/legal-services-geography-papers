This paper explores the location of business services in major European cities and focuses on the role of market factors as determinants. It is based mainly on Eurostat Urban Audit data for 51 European cities. The results confirm both a hierarchical concentration of business services and the need for a comprehensive and multidimensional approach to explanatory market factors, including demand, supply and reputation components. The most important determinants are related to business demand, urban agglomeration, accessibility and institutional frameworks. Demand-oriented factors have the strongest explanatory power, although supply factors also play a significant role.}

  abstract = {This paper discusses the theory, method and results of the Exeter Access to Justice in Rural Britain project which examined the question whether rural inhabitants are disadvantaged in terms of their access to legal services by comparison with people in urban areas. Analysis of the spatial distribution of solicitors in private practice in England and Wales revealed rural areas to be relatively well provided for. An interview survey of a random sample of solicitors in Devon and Cornwall showed some important differences between rural and urban solicitors, with the former being less specialized and more conservative in orientation. A parallel survey of managers of CABs, providing a limited legal service, also revealed some perceived differences between rural and urban bureaux and some spatial unevenness in distribution. Surveys of rural clients, supported by parallel studies elsewhere in Britain, suggest that remote rural communities harbour cases of considerable deprivation with respect to legal services.}

  abstract = {The general practitioner is the key element within most rural health care delivery systems, virtually controlling referal to higher levels of care as well as providing basic care. In consequence of the progressive urban-based centralization of health care facilities and specialized personnel encouraged by the desire to take advantage of economies of scale in supply, the role of the general practitioner within rural health care delivery has become increasingly crucial. However, the supply of general practitioners in rural areas has not kept pace with demands, and accessibility to physicians has become a pressing issue in many rural areas. Although ‘accessibility’ is not taken to be synonymous with physical or geographical accessibility, the dispersed settlement characteristic of most rural areas elevates the latter to a position of primary importance. Following a discussion of the merits of measures of accessibility based upon utilization versus measures based upon the relative location of population and physicians, a measure on potential physical accessibility is presented and applied to a Canadian data set. The results suggest that although considerable differences in potential accessibility exist between rural areas near and far from urban centres, the smaller catchment populations of most rural general practitioners may partly compensate for isolation from major, urban concentrations of physicians.}

Social Justice and access to legal services: a geographic perspective. Geoforum 21 (4), 489–502]. The current study uses data from the English and Welsh Civil and Social Justice Survey, a large-scale nationally representative survey of respondents’ experience of and response to civil and social justice problems [Pleasence, P., 2006. Causes of Action: Civil Law and Social Justice, second ed. TSO, Norwich], to examine the impact of proximity to mainstream advice services on awareness and utilisation of services. In general, proximity of advice services had a relatively modest impact on both awareness and advice seeking. However, proximity did impact upon mode of contact and there was some evidence of difference in strategy (particularly more inaction) for isolated individuals without use of motorised transport. The suitability of different modes of advice provision for particular demographic groups are discussed, as well as implications for service delivery.}

Emerging empirical research shows a dynamic growth of FinTech characterized by heterogeneity and diversity. Ecosystems, financial ecologies, and digital platform economies are the most popular approaches to FinTech, and I argue that they can be used fruitfully in combination with more established concepts, such as networks and agglomeration. Overall, I show that FinTech research is in a state of flux concerning concepts and empirics, and highlight the potential of geography to tame the beast.}

	abstract = {Objectives To analyse the relationship between health need, insurance coverage, health service availability, service use, insurance claims and out-of-pocket spending on health across Indonesia.Design Secondary analysis of nationally representative quantitative data. We merged four national data sets: the National Socioeconomic Survey 2018, National Census of Villages 2018, Population Health Development Index 2018 and National Insurance Records to end 2017. Descriptive analysis and linear regression were performed.Setting Indonesia has one of the world{\textquoteright}s largest single-payer national health insurance schemes. Data are individual and district level; all are representative for each of the country{\textquoteright}s 514 districts.Participants Anonymised secondary data from 1 131 825 individual records in the National Socioeconomic Survey and 83 931 village records in the village census. Aggregate data for 220 million insured citizens.Primary outcome measures Health service use and out-of-pocket payments, by health need, insurance status and service availability. Secondary outcome: insurance claims.Results Self-reported national health insurance registration (60.6\%) is about 10\% lower compared with the insurer{\textquoteright}s report (71.1\%). Insurance coverage is highest in poorer areas, where service provision, and thus service use and health spending, are lowest. Inpatient use is higher among the insured than the uninsured (OR 2.35, 95\% CI 2.27 to 2.42), controlling for health need and access), and poorer patients are most likely to report free inpatient care (53\% in wealth quintile 1 vs 41\% in Q5). Insured patients spend US$ 3.14 more on hospitalisation than the uninsured (95\% CI 1.98 to 4.31), but the difference disappears when controlled for wealth. Lack of services is a major constraint on service use, insurance claims and out-of-pocket spending.Conclusions The Indonesian public insurance system protects many inpatients, especially the poorest, from excessive spending. However, others, especially in Eastern Indonesia cannot benefit because few services are available. To achieve health equity, the Indonesian government needs to address supply side constraints and reduce structural underfunding.Data are available in a public, open access repository.

 abstract = {This paper explores the local availability of mental health service providers in different types rural areas. Emphasis is place upon the services available to frontier and isolated rural areas. Because persons with mental health problems may use a wide variety of social, medical and psychological providers depending on their degree of functional deficit, providers in both the general medical and the specialty mental health sectors are evaluated. This permits the determination of the extent to which both of these services are locally available in high density urban areas as well as frontier and isolated rural areas. The types of providers examined are psychiatrists, child psychiatrists, family practice physicians, all physicians, psychologists and social workers. The analysis demonstrates that mental health service providers tend to be concentrated in the densely settled counties, counties that are likely to be highly urbanized and in metropolitan areas. This is particularly true for psychiatrists and child psychiatrists and to a lesser extent psychologists and social workers. Such providers, however, are not likely to be found in frontier and isolated rural counties. While most counties, including frontier and isolated rural counties are likely to have physicians, including family practice physicians; there are many of these low density counties that do not have the services of physicians available.},

  abstractNote={An important debate has recently developed around the significance of business clusters for the development of the economy. This paper assesses the extent to which concentrated clusters of businesses exist in Britain, using the fine spatial mesh of postcode districts. It identifies the major clusters using a development of the methodology to define local labour market areas. The paper demonstrates the high degree of localization and uneven development of businesses in Britain. It also shows that business service firms are even more highly localized and clustered than other businesses. Moreover, the larger the business centre, the more localized and clustered the firms. The pattern suggests that there is a strong influence of increasing returns of scale, and that, as well as local clusters, much of the British economy is covered by one metacluster. Implications from these results are drawn for the likely future development of the economy, the location of business service suppliers in order to develop their market coverage, and local economic development policy.},
