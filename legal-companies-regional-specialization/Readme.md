The paper “Legal Services Market in Russia: Regional Specialization” was prepared for the “Geographical problems of development of countries and regions” III International Scientific and Practical Conference (Russia, Stavropol, April 17–19, 2024) and then published in the conference proceedings. Unfortunately, at this point I do not have the publication file. The bibtex entry is below.

    abstract = {This paper focuses on the spatial distribution of the legal services market in Russia. The aim is to identify the most specialized regions (constituent entities) using a quantitative technique based on the relative numbers of employees. The research utilizes open data distributed by the Federal Tax Service and the Federal Statistics Service of Russia. The regional specialization is measured using two metrics: concentration and localization. High concentration indicates regions with legal services of national importance, while high localization marks regions where legal services have local importance. The study's results reveal several clusters of legal services. These clusters are likely linked to the high level of economic activity in the regions. The location of appeal and cassation courts may also partially explain the clusters.},
