Using the frame of the ‘FinTech Cube’, we examine how FinTech unfolds through the intersections of key actors, technologies and institutions. We demonstrate the relevance of FinTech for two areas of geographical enquiry: i) the reshaping of global production and financial networks, and ii) financial inclusion and poverty reduction in poorer countries. In doing so, we accord particular attention to the significance of FinTech for theoretical and empirical research in economic geography.}

Emerging empirical research shows a dynamic growth of FinTech characterized by heterogeneity and diversity. Ecosystems, financial ecologies, and digital platform economies are the most popular approaches to FinTech, and I argue that they can be used fruitfully in combination with more established concepts, such as networks and agglomeration. Overall, I show that FinTech research is in a state of flux concerning concepts and empirics, and highlight the potential of geography to tame the beast.}

  abstractNote={Introduction. Foreign European countries, dominating in the modern world economy, show signs of heterogeneity of development, especially in the tertiary sector of the economy. The purpose of the study is to perform a systematic and structural analysis of the development of the countries according to the Purchasing Managers’ Index in the service sector and to identify factors affecting the changes in this index. Materials and Methods. Statistical data from open sources were used as materials. The study employed such methods as the systemic and structural analysis (understanding the Index and its composite nature, the typology of foreign European countries), the spatial analysis of business activity in the service sector (differentiation of countries), and the structural and functional approach (factors that influence the changes in the Purchasing Managers’ Index). Results. The Purchasing Managers’ Index in the service sector has been analyzed. The methodology for calculation of the Index has been described; its strengths and weaknesses, as well as its impact on the economy have been assessed. A typology of foreign European countries has been created according to the leading macroeconomic indicator – the composite Purchasing Managers’ Index. This made it possible to draw a parallel with the socio-economic development of the countries of the studied region in terms of the ‘center-periphery’ model. The internal and external factors in the development of business activities in the service sector of national economies have been identified. Discussion and Conclusion. The development of the service sector has been studied at the level of foreign European countries. The composite Purchasing Managers’ Index has been considered as an indicator of the development over time. The authors have been able to expose the issues of studying the tertiary sector of the economy as one of the relevant areas of macro-regional research. The territorial differentiation of the countries according to their business activity in the service sector has been revealed, which can be used in projected estimates in the field of management and implementation of regional policies. The proposed approach to the study of the service sector can be applied at country and regional levels.},

The second part analyzes the market indicators of the global legal services market, characterizes the main problems and trends in its development. The place and role of Russia in the global legal services market are revealed. The third part deals with the foreign trade policy issues, mechanisms for protecting the internal market. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the Services Trade Restrictiveness Index for legal services. The mechanism of countries foreign trade policies influence on the British legal services sector is illustrated in the context of Brexit.},

  abstract = {In recent years, employment in services, especially in producer services, has expanded rapidly in the United States. Meanwhile, employment in manufacturing has remained relatively constant, although the proportion of production workers in manufacturing has declined. A common belief is that these phenomena have adversely affected productivity because most productivity gains are made in the direct production of goods. This view fails to take into account the complex nature of production organization in an economy increasingly based on flexible production, knowledge, information, and communications. Producer services, through their sophisticated interactions with goods production and other service activities, have been playing a strategic role in increasing productivity. Moreover, producer services are frequently exported and can provide a catalyst for regional development. There needs to be greater recognition of, and more research on, the nature and significance of productivity-enhancing interactions among producer services, goods production, and the quality of the labor force.}

Yet, the mechanisms through which they influence the activities of lead and supplier firms in GPNs have received little in-depth attention. This article addresses the shortcoming and examines how global legal business services configure the financial discipline of transnational corporations (TNCs) in Southeast Asia. It documents the way FABS articulate financial imperatives and encourages the reproduction of ‘global financial architectures’. It also shows, however, that temporal dynamics and spatial specificities in the power relations between FABS and TNCs generate variegated financial configurations. Southeast Asian TNCs adopt and adapt in ways that serve their interests. This implies that the governance effects of FABS have important temporal and spatial contingencies that need to be accounted for in analyses of GPNs.}",

Informed by three theories of spatial change—law firms (i) following the geographic expansion of their clients, relying on (ii) traditional agglomeration economies and relying on (iii) agglomeration benefits emerging from a location’s connectivity to other important geographies—we analyze longitudinal data on large U.S. law firms and the global urban network in which they are embedded. We find that, after the late 2000s, geographic expansion was less connected to organic market growth in U.S. domestic markets and London, a plausible explanation being the global financial crisis. At the same time, growth has continued in key foreign markets. We demonstrate how network analysis and a relational approach to organizations and organizational fields can yield insights into the structure and dynamics of industries.}",
