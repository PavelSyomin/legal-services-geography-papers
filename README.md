# Papers about legal services geography in Russia

## Summary

This repository contains source code for a number of papers based on open data about small and medium-sized enterprises in Russia. Some of them are conference papers, the other are journal articles. Some are in English, some are in Russian. Almost all the papers deals with the various aspects of the geography of legal services in Russia. All the papers accompany my PhD thesis on legal services geography in Russia. The thesis has not been defended yet, but almost all the papers have already been published.

## Papers details

In the following tables, links reference the particular folders with the paper's code, text, published PDF (if any), and citation info. Papers are sorted in the order of conference/publication date. Unpublished papers (currently, there is one unpublished paper) are not listed.

Some journal articles were first presented on conferences, and then enhanced and published in the journals without a separate publication in conference proceedings. In this case, they are placed in the “Journal articles” section without a record in “Conference papers”, and the relevant conference details can be found on the particular paper's page.

*InterCatro.InterGIS* is a conference proceedings, but usually it is referred to as a journal, thus the respective paper is placed in the “Journal articles”.

## Reproducibility

All the papers have been designed to follow the principles of open science and reproducible research. In particular, they are based on open data (primarily [open administrative data published by Federal Tax Service of Russia](https://www.nalog.gov.ru/opendata/)) and written with [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). All the code used to generate the papers is available in this repository, and the auxiliary datasets are also published. I hope that the steps outlined below will be enough to fully reproduce the main results of the research as well as the entire texts of the papers.
