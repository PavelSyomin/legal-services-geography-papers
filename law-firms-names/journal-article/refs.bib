	abstract = {In the Russian Federation, noticeable differences remain among its constituent entities in terms of citizens’ access to high-quality medical care. The primary challenges in the development of the nation’s healthcare system and its various regions are closely linked to demographic trends and the need to address mortality problems. The state of regional healthcare systems plays a pivotal role in influencing mortality rates, which, in turn, serves as a reflection of the regional and municipal healthcare systems’ overall development. Consequently, the development of an algorithm or methodology for assessing the effectiveness of healthcare systems, as mandated by strategic and territorial planning documents at all administrative levels, has become a pressing scientific concern and the focal point of this research. The development of the algorithm involved a multifactor analysis and geoinformation mapping methods. The authors have developed specific criteria to evaluate the current state of healthcare systems in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation and municipalities, taking into account their impact on target socio-economic indicators and mortality rates aligned with the national objectives of the Russian Federation, as well as the goals outlined in the National Projects «Healthcare» and «Demography.» Through a comprehensive analysis of demographic and socio-economic factors, the research has unveiled distinctive characteristics in the spatial organization and structure of healthcare systems, both at the municipal and constituent entity levels within the Russian Federation. This analysis has facilitated the development of typologies for the constituent entities based on a comprehensive composite indicator that encompasses both medical and non-medical factors. The authors have introduced a system of cartographic indicators designed to evaluate the efficiency of the spatial organization of healthcare systems at various territorial levels, encompassing constituent entities of the Russian Federation, municipalities, and settlements. To support this evaluation, the authors have prepared a series of original cartographic materials for each level, featuring corresponding assessment indicators.},

  abstract={Introduction Unmet need for healthcare is a proxy indicator used to assess the performance of healthcare systems throughout the world. While the Russian Federation is committed to improving healthcare for its citizens, barriers to access remain.Methods Using data from a region-level survey, we document and analyse the extent of the unmet need for healthcare at both national and subnational levels in the Russian Federation for the years 2014--2018. We used a panel fixed effects modelling approach to examine the link between unmet need and its correlates at the subnational level. We also used data from various sources that addressed the reasons underlying unmet need to interpret the findings from the modelling analysis.Results Approximately one-third of the Russian population (34.7{\%} in 2018) reported that healthcare was not received when it was needed with little change observed between 2014 and 2018. We observed significant variation across the various regions in Russia. The prevalence of unmet need was substantially higher in the regions of the Volga, Siberia and Far East Federal Districts. Our analysis revealed that the density of hospital beds and economic development across regions were correlated with the prevalence of unmet need. Dissatisfaction with healthcare services, perceived lack of effective treatments and financial constraints were the main reasons offered for forgoing healthcare when needed.Conclusions An unanticipated positive link between unmet need and hospital bed density might be attributed to the low accessibility and quality of primary healthcare. High demand and supply of inpatient care do not compensate for the structural imbalances of the current healthcare model. Strengthening and improving the quality of primary care might significantly reduce the prevalence of unmet need.},

  abstractNote={The demand for digital technologies has been growing due to a shift in the technological and economic paradigm. The need for online services has increased since the beginning of the COVID pandemic. There are significant disparities between Russian regions in the digital technology accessibility and the development of computer skills. In 2020, the Internet diffused rapidly in most regions, although previously, there had been a slowdown. As markets got saturated with digital services, the digital divide between Russian regions narrowed. Overall, the Internet use patterns are consistent with those of the spatial diffusion of innovations. Amongst the leaders, there are regions home to the largest agglomerations and northern territories of Russia, whereas those having a high proportion of rural population lag behind. Coastal and border regions (St. Petersburg, the Kaliningrad region, Karelia, Primorsky Krai, etc.) have better access to the Internet due to their proximity to the centres of technological innovations as well as the high intensity of external relations. Leading regions have an impact on their neighbours through spatial diffusion. Econometrically, access to the Internet depends on income, the average age and level of education, and its use depends on the business climate and Internet accessibility factors. Regional markets are gradually getting more saturated with digital services and technologies. The difference between regions in terms of access to the Internet is twofold, whereas, in terms of digital technology use, the gap is manifold. In many regions, the share of online commerce, which became the driver of economic development during the lockdown, is minimal. Based on the results of the study, several recommendations have been formulated.},

  abstract = {In recent years, employment in services, especially in producer services, has expanded rapidly in the United States. Meanwhile, employment in manufacturing has remained relatively constant, although the proportion of production workers in manufacturing has declined. A common belief is that these phenomena have adversely affected productivity because most productivity gains are made in the direct production of goods. This view fails to take into account the complex nature of production organization in an economy increasingly based on flexible production, knowledge, information, and communications. Producer services, through their sophisticated interactions with goods production and other service activities, have been playing a strategic role in increasing productivity. Moreover, producer services are frequently exported and can provide a catalyst for regional development. There needs to be greater recognition of, and more research on, the nature and significance of productivity-enhancing interactions among producer services, goods production, and the quality of the labor force.}

It documents the way FABS articulate financial imperatives and encourages the reproduction of ‘global financial architectures’. It also shows, however, that temporal dynamics and spatial specificities in the power relations between FABS and TNCs generate variegated financial configurations. Southeast Asian TNCs adopt and adapt in ways that serve their interests. This implies that the governance effects of FABS have important temporal and spatial contingencies that need to be accounted for in analyses of GPNs.}",

Analysis of the spatial distribution of solicitors in private practice in England and Wales revealed rural areas to be relatively well provided for. An interview survey of a random sample of solicitors in Devon and Cornwall showed some important differences between rural and urban solicitors, with the former being less specialized and more conservative in orientation. A parallel survey of managers of CABs, providing a limited legal service, also revealed some perceived differences between rural and urban bureaux and some spatial unevenness in distribution. Surveys of rural clients, supported by parallel studies elsewhere in Britain, suggest that remote rural communities harbour cases of considerable deprivation with respect to legal services.}

More than 300 names have been used in the naming of gaming in Las Vegas since 1955. They occur in seven dominant patterns: 1) luck and good fortune, 2) wealth and opulence, 3) action, adventure, excitement and fantasy, 4) geography, 5) a certain moment, era, or season, 6) intimacy and informality, and 7) “power words” commonly used in the naming of businesses. The categories are described and analyzed from the perspective of the evolution of Las Vegas. Regional variations between the Las Vegas Strip, Downtown Las Vegas, and suburban Las Vegas are also discussed. The names provide a powerful means of evoking senses of place, images, and identities for the casinos. They underscore the interpretative subjectivity and plurality of the relationship between people and commercial urban environments.},

  abstract={Corporate (re-)naming is a way to (re-)brand a company, and it still represents an under-researched area of inquiry, especially in the higher education industry. Universities may use (re-)naming strategies to (re-)brand themselves and face the increasing global competition in the marketplace. The present article focuses on two widespread naming options: a city-of-location naming strategy, referring to a university name that integrates the city where the institution is located, and a region-of-location naming strategy, referring to a name that incorporates the corresponding geographical region where the university is located. The research aims to examine and compare the effects of these two strategies on users' perceptions. Results of two distinct studies show that a city-of-location naming strategy is superior to a region-of-location one in promoting a university's brand, in terms of users' acceptance of, and preference for, the university's name and in terms of perceived recognizability, memorability, distinctiveness, credibility and personality profiles of the (re-)named university as well. Managerial implications suggest the necessity for university managers to undertake name change strategies carefully, especially when these strategies entail a shift from a city-of-location-based name to a region-of-location-based one.},

  abstract={Purpose This research finds out to what extent companies' names are influenced by the place's attributes versus the official branding policies of a place and, consequently, whether and how local companies ``buy into'' the place's strategies put forth by official bodies. Design/methodology/approach This paper is both conceptual and empirical, as a mixed quantitative and interpretive approach is used. The companies' names of a tourist industry (the tour and guiding companies) in three destinations are compared and pitched against the branding of these cities. The companies' names are classified into categories to ascertain whether they reflect (or diverge from) the official strategies. Finally, a conceptual model is developed to explain the findings: the strategic naming model (SNM). Findings Our main finding is that the overall business features of a place being stronger determinants to the naming strategies than tourist destination branding initiatives. The intrinsic features of a place seem thus to be ``above'' destination branding policies. The researched features account for different naming strategies, such as highly original names, flat names or non-strategic names. Research limitations/implications As the work is based on a convenience sample, it cannot claim strong representativity. The fact that each of the three data sets was processed by a different researcher might bring up personal biases. Practical implications This work is a call for a more intensive use of naming strategies to the companies' advantages, as naming is found out to be strategy used to a very low degree. Thanks to this research, companies will understand the different naming possibilities and be able to apply them to their strategies by choosing names which express ``uniqueness'' or ``belonging''. Practitioners will also be aware of whether they are communicating towards the industry or towards the market. Originality/value No works were found that empirically pursue our research goals. Therefore, this research might be considered as a novelty. The proposed SNM model explains and relates the most usual company naming techniques, which were unrelated up to date.},

  abstract={Research on brand naming has recently taken center stage in marketing literature. This study formulates a comprehensive classification of brand names that incorporates frameworks from existing literature and current naming methods used by practitioners. A content analysis of the top 500 global brand names based on manifest content, across 11 product categories, was conducted to understand the current brand-naming trends. The results confirm extensive use of the promoter's name and place of origin (39.7 per cent of all brand names coded), compounding (34.1 per cent), abbreviations (18.2 per cent) and blending (7.9 per cent). Category-wise analysis indicates that certain categories, such as durables, follow the aggregate pattern of 61.5 per cent semantic word names, 53.0 per cent invented word names and 23.6 per cent non-word names. FMCG brands, on the other hand, show differing patterns because of disproportionately low abbreviations in the distribution. Further, $\chi$2 tests using equal expected frequencies of the three dimensions; semantic, invented and non-word names, showed that there appears to be significant differences in frequency between these dimensions. Practitioners may consider using these newly defined categories, such as semantically related acronyms, in creating distinctive brand names. This study also analyzes the use of sound symbolic names for brands.},
