	abstract = {In the Russian Federation, noticeable differences remain among its constituent entities in terms of citizens’ access to high-quality medical care. The primary challenges in the development of the nation’s healthcare system and its various regions are closely linked to demographic trends and the need to address mortality problems. The state of regional healthcare systems plays a pivotal role in influencing mortality rates, which, in turn, serves as a reflection of the regional and municipal healthcare systems’ overall development. Consequently, the development of an algorithm or methodology for assessing the effectiveness of healthcare systems, as mandated by strategic and territorial planning documents at all administrative levels, has become a pressing scientific concern and the focal point of this research. The development of the algorithm involved a multifactor analysis and geoinformation mapping methods. The authors have developed specific criteria to evaluate the current state of healthcare systems in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation and municipalities, taking into account their impact on target socio-economic indicators and mortality rates aligned with the national objectives of the Russian Federation, as well as the goals outlined in the National Projects «Healthcare» and «Demography.» Through a comprehensive analysis of demographic and socio-economic factors, the research has unveiled distinctive characteristics in the spatial organization and structure of healthcare systems, both at the municipal and constituent entity levels within the Russian Federation. This analysis has facilitated the development of typologies for the constituent entities based on a comprehensive composite indicator that encompasses both medical and non-medical factors. The authors have introduced a system of cartographic indicators designed to evaluate the efficiency of the spatial organization of healthcare systems at various territorial levels, encompassing constituent entities of the Russian Federation, municipalities, and settlements. To support this evaluation, the authors have prepared a series of original cartographic materials for each level, featuring corresponding assessment indicators.},

  abstract={Introduction Unmet need for healthcare is a proxy indicator used to assess the performance of healthcare systems throughout the world. While the Russian Federation is committed to improving healthcare for its citizens, barriers to access remain.Methods Using data from a region-level survey, we document and analyse the extent of the unmet need for healthcare at both national and subnational levels in the Russian Federation for the years 2014--2018. We used a panel fixed effects modelling approach to examine the link between unmet need and its correlates at the subnational level. We also used data from various sources that addressed the reasons underlying unmet need to interpret the findings from the modelling analysis.Results Approximately one-third of the Russian population (34.7{\%} in 2018) reported that healthcare was not received when it was needed with little change observed between 2014 and 2018. We observed significant variation across the various regions in Russia. The prevalence of unmet need was substantially higher in the regions of the Volga, Siberia and Far East Federal Districts. Our analysis revealed that the density of hospital beds and economic development across regions were correlated with the prevalence of unmet need. Dissatisfaction with healthcare services, perceived lack of effective treatments and financial constraints were the main reasons offered for forgoing healthcare when needed.Conclusions An unanticipated positive link between unmet need and hospital bed density might be attributed to the low accessibility and quality of primary healthcare. High demand and supply of inpatient care do not compensate for the structural imbalances of the current healthcare model. Strengthening and improving the quality of primary care might significantly reduce the prevalence of unmet need.},

  abstractNote={The demand for digital technologies has been growing due to a shift in the technological and economic paradigm. The need for online services has increased since the beginning of the COVID pandemic. There are significant disparities between Russian regions in the digital technology accessibility and the development of computer skills. In 2020, the Internet diffused rapidly in most regions, although previously, there had been a slowdown. As markets got saturated with digital services, the digital divide between Russian regions narrowed. Overall, the Internet use patterns are consistent with those of the spatial diffusion of innovations. Amongst the leaders, there are regions home to the largest agglomerations and northern territories of Russia, whereas those having a high proportion of rural population lag behind. Coastal and border regions (St. Petersburg, the Kaliningrad region, Karelia, Primorsky Krai, etc.) have better access to the Internet due to their proximity to the centres of technological innovations as well as the high intensity of external relations. Leading regions have an impact on their neighbours through spatial diffusion. Econometrically, access to the Internet depends on income, the average age and level of education, and its use depends on the business climate and Internet accessibility factors. Regional markets are gradually getting more saturated with digital services and technologies. The difference between regions in terms of access to the Internet is twofold, whereas, in terms of digital technology use, the gap is manifold. In many regions, the share of online commerce, which became the driver of economic development during the lockdown, is minimal. Based on the results of the study, several recommendations have been formulated.},

  abstract = {In recent years, employment in services, especially in producer services, has expanded rapidly in the United States. Meanwhile, employment in manufacturing has remained relatively constant, although the proportion of production workers in manufacturing has declined. A common belief is that these phenomena have adversely affected productivity because most productivity gains are made in the direct production of goods. This view fails to take into account the complex nature of production organization in an economy increasingly based on flexible production, knowledge, information, and communications. Producer services, through their sophisticated interactions with goods production and other service activities, have been playing a strategic role in increasing productivity. Moreover, producer services are frequently exported and can provide a catalyst for regional development. There needs to be greater recognition of, and more research on, the nature and significance of productivity-enhancing interactions among producer services, goods production, and the quality of the labor force.}

Yet, the mechanisms through which they influence the activities of lead and supplier firms in GPNs have received little in-depth attention. This article addresses the shortcoming and examines how global legal business services configure the financial discipline of transnational corporations (TNCs) in Southeast Asia. It documents the way FABS articulate financial imperatives and encourages the reproduction of ‘global financial architectures’. It also shows, however, that temporal dynamics and spatial specificities in the power relations between FABS and TNCs generate variegated financial configurations. Southeast Asian TNCs adopt and adapt in ways that serve their interests. This implies that the governance effects of FABS have important temporal and spatial contingencies that need to be accounted for in analyses of GPNs.}",

  abstract = {This paper discusses the theory, method and results of the Exeter Access to Justice in Rural Britain project which examined the question whether rural inhabitants are disadvantaged in terms of their access to legal services by comparison with people in urban areas. Analysis of the spatial distribution of solicitors in private practice in England and Wales revealed rural areas to be relatively well provided for. An interview survey of a random sample of solicitors in Devon and Cornwall showed some important differences between rural and urban solicitors, with the former being less specialized and more conservative in orientation. A parallel survey of managers of CABs, providing a limited legal service, also revealed some perceived differences between rural and urban bureaux and some spatial unevenness in distribution. Surveys of rural clients, supported by parallel studies elsewhere in Britain, suggest that remote rural communities harbour cases of considerable deprivation with respect to legal services.}
