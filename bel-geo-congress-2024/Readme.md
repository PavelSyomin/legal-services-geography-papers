    abstract = {The migration of Russian commercial legal companies in 2016–23 is described and analyzed. Distributions by migration count and distance are estimated and visualized, the relationship between company size and migration decision is statistically tested, net migration rate by region is mapped, and top migration paths are listed. It is found that migrations are rare, mostly short-distance (10–50 km). Bigger companies tend to relocate more often. Moscow has probably lost small and inefficient businesses but gained larger and more profitable ones.},
