    abstractNote={This paper presents a flexible and reproducible workflow for creating highly detailed maps of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in Russia. Currently, there is a lack of data sources for mapping the Russian economy, and existing official datasets often provide location information in human-readable addresses rather than machine-readable geographical coordinates. The proposed set of tools aims to solve this problem and simplify the mapping process. The study utilizes three open datasets published by the Federal Tax Service, including open dumps of SMB registry, as its data source. To transform the source data into tables and normalize and geocode the addresses, a Python CLI application was developed. Despite the large volume of the initial data archives, the application can run on a regular modern personal computer without the need for cloud computing resources. The workflow’s usability is demonstrated by mapping a small subset of data, specifically legal companies in Russia.},
