  abstract = {{The paper examines the role of discourse in supporting firm{\textquoteright}s decisions to relocate and how main actors influence such discourse. If there is uncertainty about the general{\textless}br{\textgreater}functioning of the economy, discourse is the place where ideas and paradigms, and possible options of behavior, are created. Since interests are not given a priori but are{\textless}br{\textgreater}socially constructed, discourse contributes to their definition by selecting, amplifying and legitimizing arguments and causal relationships between the functioning of the market and individual behavior. Some surveys of German companies show that while relocation is increasing, the advantages for firms are less clear than expected. The main argument of the paper is that the public debate in German newspapers and the business press since the 1990s could have influenced the processes of decision-making over{\textless}br{\textgreater}relocation by amplifying the disadvantages of remaining in Germany and neglecting the conflicts and additional costs arising for companies by relocating their production{\textless}br{\textgreater}activities.}},

  abstract = { The authors model how state business incentives influence interstate relocation patterns of manufacturers using a panel (2000-2011) of 32 states. The National Establishment Time Series database and the Panel Database on Incentives and Taxes are used to study relocation by manufacturing establishments based on differences between the origin and destination states. The authors find that traditional factors associated with business climate, such as taxation and subsidies, statistically influence manufacturing interstate relocation. Further analysis shows that policy changes (e.g., increasing incentives and reducing taxes) to induce manufacturers to relocate may need to be infeasibly large or used in combination to evoke an economically meaningful increase in relocations. }

  abstract = {Conflicts of interest between local governments and the central administration in China have yielded many local policies that only serve the interests of local governments. The policy of first levying and then rebating taxes is an example of how local governments eschew the national tax regulations to boost local economies rather than national interests. In 2001, the Chinese government announced the termination of local tax rebates, which had some expected outcomes. We find that local governments complied with the new tax policy even though it no longer allowed local governments to grant tax incentives. However, some companies found ways to avoid the greater tax burdens by moving their business registration locations to tax havens. We also find that firms controlled by local governments were less likely to change registration locations. Our study examines the national tax regulation in China and explores how tax rules influence company decisions. In addition, we show that non-tax incentives, such as local economic development, may also influence company decisions.}

However, recent data from the USA show that rural counties have attracted some businesses from urban counties. This is the first study to focus on these relocations and to explore what locational factors drive these migration flows. We pay specific attention to measures of agglomeration in the form of urbanization economies, market potential and regional specialization. Using county-to-county relocation data, origin and destination characteristics and differences of those characteristics, we find that while traditional measures of urban agglomeration such as proximity to urban locations and population density as pull factors show statistical significance and the expected positive sign, the role of more specific measures such as regional specialization and market potential has the opposite or no effects on the relocation of businesses from urban to rural areas. A key and strong finding is that relocating establishments seem to prefer destination locations that are similar to their respective origins in most respects, except natural amenities where moving establishments prefer dissimilar locations. In particular, if relocation is to high-amenity rural locations, it takes place even in the absence of significant differences in other location factors.}",
