This paper explores the location of business services in major European cities and focuses on the role of market factors as determinants. It is based mainly on Eurostat Urban Audit data for 51 European cities. The results confirm both a hierarchical concentration of business services and the need for a comprehensive and multidimensional approach to explanatory market factors, including demand, supply and reputation components. The most important determinants are related to business demand, urban agglomeration, accessibility and institutional frameworks. Demand-oriented factors have the strongest explanatory power, although supply factors also play a significant role.}

Analysis of the spatial distribution of solicitors in private practice in England and Wales revealed rural areas to be relatively well provided for. An interview survey of a random sample of solicitors in Devon and Cornwall showed some important differences between rural and urban solicitors, with the former being less specialized and more conservative in orientation. A parallel survey of managers of CABs, providing a limited legal service, also revealed some perceived differences between rural and urban bureaux and some spatial unevenness in distribution. Surveys of rural clients, supported by parallel studies elsewhere in Britain, suggest that remote rural communities harbour cases of considerable deprivation with respect to legal services.}

  abstract = {The general practitioner is the key element within most rural health care delivery systems, virtually controlling referal to higher levels of care as well as providing basic care. In consequence of the progressive urban-based centralization of health care facilities and specialized personnel encouraged by the desire to take advantage of economies of scale in supply, the role of the general practitioner within rural health care delivery has become increasingly crucial. However, the supply of general practitioners in rural areas has not kept pace with demands, and accessibility to physicians has become a pressing issue in many rural areas. Although ‘accessibility’ is not taken to be synonymous with physical or geographical accessibility, the dispersed settlement characteristic of most rural areas elevates the latter to a position of primary importance. Following a discussion of the merits of measures of accessibility based upon utilization versus measures based upon the relative location of population and physicians, a measure on potential physical accessibility is presented and applied to a Canadian data set. The results suggest that although considerable differences in potential accessibility exist between rural areas near and far from urban centres, the smaller catchment populations of most rural general practitioners may partly compensate for isolation from major, urban concentrations of physicians.}

In general, proximity of advice services had a relatively modest impact on both awareness and advice seeking. However, proximity did impact upon mode of contact and there was some evidence of difference in strategy (particularly more inaction) for isolated individuals without use of motorised transport. The suitability of different modes of advice provision for particular demographic groups are discussed, as well as implications for service delivery.}

We merged four national data sets: the National Socioeconomic Survey 2018, National Census of Villages 2018, Population Health Development Index 2018 and National Insurance Records to end 2017. Descriptive analysis and linear regression were performed.Setting Indonesia has one of the world{\textquoteright}s largest single-payer national health insurance schemes. Data are individual and district level; all are representative for each of the country{\textquoteright}s 514 districts.Participants Anonymised secondary data from 1 131 825 individual records in the National Socioeconomic Survey and 83 931 village records in the village census. Aggregate data for 220 million insured citizens.Primary outcome measures Health service use and out-of-pocket payments, by health need, insurance status and service availability. Secondary outcome: insurance claims.Results Self-reported national health insurance registration (60.6\%) is about 10\% lower compared with the insurer{\textquoteright}s report (71.1\%). Insurance coverage is highest in poorer areas, where service provision, and thus service use and health spending, are lowest. Inpatient use is higher among the insured than the uninsured (OR 2.35, 95\% CI 2.27 to 2.42), controlling for health need and access), and poorer patients are most likely to report free inpatient care (53\% in wealth quintile 1 vs 41\% in Q5). Insured patients spend US$ 3.14 more on hospitalisation than the uninsured (95\% CI 1.98 to 4.31), but the difference disappears when controlled for wealth. Lack of services is a major constraint on service use, insurance claims and out-of-pocket spending.Conclusions The Indonesian public insurance system protects many inpatients, especially the poorest, from excessive spending. However, others, especially in Eastern Indonesia cannot benefit because few services are available. To achieve health equity, the Indonesian government needs to address supply side constraints and reduce structural underfunding.Data are available in a public, open access repository.

 abstract = {This paper explores the local availability of mental health service providers in different types rural areas. Emphasis is place upon the services available to frontier and isolated rural areas. Because persons with mental health problems may use a wide variety of social, medical and psychological providers depending on their degree of functional deficit, providers in both the general medical and the specialty mental health sectors are evaluated. This permits the determination of the extent to which both of these services are locally available in high density urban areas as well as frontier and isolated rural areas. The types of providers examined are psychiatrists, child psychiatrists, family practice physicians, all physicians, psychologists and social workers. The analysis demonstrates that mental health service providers tend to be concentrated in the densely settled counties, counties that are likely to be highly urbanized and in metropolitan areas. This is particularly true for psychiatrists and child psychiatrists and to a lesser extent psychologists and social workers. Such providers, however, are not likely to be found in frontier and isolated rural counties. While most counties, including frontier and isolated rural counties are likely to have physicians, including family practice physicians; there are many of these low density counties that do not have the services of physicians available.},

This paper assesses the extent to which concentrated clusters of businesses exist in Britain, using the fine spatial mesh of postcode districts. It identifies the major clusters using a development of the methodology to define local labour market areas. The paper demonstrates the high degree of localization and uneven development of businesses in Britain. It also shows that business service firms are even more highly localized and clustered than other businesses. Moreover, the larger the business centre, the more localized and clustered the firms. The pattern suggests that there is a strong influence of increasing returns of scale, and that, as well as local clusters, much of the British economy is covered by one metacluster. Implications from these results are drawn for the likely future development of the economy, the location of business service suppliers in order to develop their market coverage, and local economic development policy.},

	abstract = {Background: Most of the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) aim to ensure equitable access to health care. This is often interpreted as requiring that care be available on the basis of need and not willingness or ability to pay. We sought to examine equity in physician utilization in 21 OECD countries for the year 2000. Methods: Using data from national surveys or from the European Community Household Panel, we extracted the number of visits to a general practitioner or medical specialist over the previous 12 months. Visits were standardized for need differences using age, sex and reported health levels as proxies. We measured inequity in doctor utilization by income using concentration indices of the need-standardized use. Results: We found inequity in physician utilization favouring patients who are better off in about half of the OECD countries studied. The degree of pro-rich inequity in doctor use is highest in the United States and Mexico, followed by Finland, Portugal and Sweden. In most countries, we found no evidence of inequity in the distribution of general practitioner visits across income groups, and where it does occur, it often indicates a pro-poor distribution. However, in all countries for which data are available, after controlling for need differences, people with higher incomes are significantly more likely to see a specialist than people with lower incomes and, in most countries, also more frequently. Pro-rich inequity is especially large in Portugal, Finland and Ireland. Interpretation: Although in most OECD countries general practitioner care is distributed fairly equally and is often even pro-poor, the very pro-rich distribution of specialist care tends to make total doctor utilization somewhat pro-rich. This phenomenon appears to be universal, but it is reinforced when private insurance or private care options are offered.},

  abstract={Access to healthcare is a requirement for human well-being that is constrained, in part, by the allocation of healthcare resources relative to the geographically dispersed human population1--3. Quantifying access to care globally is challenging due to the absence of a comprehensive database of healthcare facilities. We harness major data collection efforts underway by OpenStreetMap, Google Maps and academic researchers to compile the most complete collection of facility locations to date. Leveraging the geographically variable strengths of our facility datasets, we use an established methodology4 to characterize travel time to healthcare facilities in unprecedented detail. We produce maps of travel time with and without access to motorized transport, thus characterizing travel time to healthcare for populations distributed across the wealth spectrum. We find that just 8.9{\%} of the global population (646 million people) cannot reach healthcare within one hour if they have access to motorized transport, and that 43.3{\%} (3.16 billion people) cannot reach a healthcare facility by foot within one hour. Our maps highlight an additional vulnerability faced by poorer individuals in remote areas and can help to estimate whether individuals will seek healthcare when it is needed, as well as providing an evidence base for efficiently distributing limited healthcare and transportation resources to underserved populations both now and in the future.},

In a large state like Texas with vast rural areas and limited public transit infrastructure, 75{\%} of the children live over an hour from the closest facility that provides pediatric emergency services or specialty care. In view of this challenge, this study first sought to map the prevailing geographical accessibility to children's hospitals and, second, to model the hospital beds per capita for each hospital's service area within the state of Texas. The results showed disparities in accessing emergency pediatric care, especially in rural areas. However, despite major metro areas recording better geographical accessibility to pediatric healthcare, residents in these areas may experience limited hospital bed availability. The findings indicate an urgent need for more pediatric healthcare services in rural Texas. Given the increasing population growth in metro areas and their surroundings, there is also a need for the expansion of healthcare infrastructure in these areas.},
